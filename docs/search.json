    "text": "1 Introduction\nOver the last couple of decades, climate change has been cited as a major contributor to the increased frequency of extreme weather events such as hurricanes [1]. According to the Environmental Defense Fund, “stronger hurricanes are becoming more common in a warmer climate. Researchers suggest that the most damaging U.S. hurricanes are three times more frequent than 100 years ago and that the proportion of major hurricanes (Category 3 or above) in the Atlantic Ocean has doubled since 1980.” This project aims to understand the patterns and trends of these events over time.\nExtreme weather events are natural occurrences, but their patterns can be significantly influenced by broader climatic changes. Studying these events helps us grasp the implications of a changing climate. It’s not just about understanding the science; it’s also about appreciating the real-world impacts - how these events affect ecosystems, human lives, and economies. With climate change being a pressing global issue, research in this area is not just academic but has profound real-world implications.\nIt is estimated that the cost generated by hurricanes in the United States since 1980 has surpassed 363 billion dollars [2]. The figure below, provides an illustration of States that most at risk of hurricanes [3].\n\n\n\nUS States Most at Risk\n\n\nRecurrently, the states that see themselves most impacted by these tropical cyclones among other climate change phenomena are:\n\nFlorida\nLouisiana\nNorth Carolina\nTexas\nSouth Carolina\n\nTo narrow the scope of the project, we will focus on these locations, which according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is among the top states for hurricane frequency. The data that we are working on is obtained from the Hurricane Research Division at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nReferences\n\n[1] https://www.edf.org/climate/how-climate-change-makes-hurricanes-more-destructive#:~:text=Stronger%20hurricanes%20are%20becoming%20more,Ocean%20has%20doubled%20since%201980\n[2] https://coast.noaa.gov/states/fast-facts/hurricane-costs.html#:~:text=Tropical%20Cyclones%3A%20The%20Highest%20Costs,of%20%2422.8%20billion%20per%20event\n[3] https://www.generalitravelinsurance.com/travel-resources/hurricane-risk-map.html"

    "section": "2.1 Techincal Description",
    "text": "2.1 Techincal Description\nAs previously mentioned, this project leverages information from National Hurricane Center (NHC) which is a part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In particular, we focus on a hurricane dataset named HURDAT2, “a comma-delimited, text format with six-hourly information on the location, maximum winds, central pressure, and (beginning in 2004) size of all known tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones”. Below is a short description of the way the NHC collects the data directly from their website:\nThe NHC conducts a post-storm analysis of each tropical cyclone in its area of responsibility to determine the official assessment of the cyclone’s history. This analysis makes use of all available observations, including those that may not have been available in real time. In addition, NHC conducts ongoing reviews of any retrospective tropical cyclone analyses brought to its attention, and on a regular basis updates the historical record to reflect changes introduced via the Best Track Change Committee (Landsea et al. 2004a, 2004b, 2008, 2012, Hagen et al. 2012, Kieper et al. 2016, and Delgado et al. 2018). NHC has traditionally disseminated the tropical cyclone historical database in a format known as HURDAT (short for HURricane DATabase – Jarvinen et al. 1984). [1]\nListed below is the description of the features in the dataset:\n\nRecord identifier: This code is used to identify records that correspond to landfalls or to indicate the reason for inclusion of a record not at the standard synoptic times (0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 UTC). For the years 1851-1970 and 1991 onward, all continental United States landfalls are marked, while international landfalls are only marked from 1951 to 1970 and 1991 onward. The landfall identifier (L) is the only identifier that will appear with a standard synoptic time record. The remaining identifiers (see table above) are only used with asynoptic records to indicate the reason for their inclusion. Inclusion of asynoptic data is at the discretion of the Hurricane Specialist who performed the post-storm analysis; standards for inclusion or non-inclusion have varied over time. Identification of asynoptic peaks in intensity (either wind or pressure) may represent either system’s lifetime peak or a secondary peak.\nTime: Nearly all HURDAT2 records correspond to the synoptic times of 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800. Recording best track data to the nearest minute became available within the b-decks beginning in 1991 and some tropical cyclones since that year have the landfall best track to the nearest minute.\nStatus: Tropical cyclones with an ending tropical depression status (the dissipating stage) were first used in the best track beginning in 1871, primarily for systems weakening over land. Tropical cyclones with beginning tropical depression (the formation stage) were first included in the best track beginning in 1882. Subtropical depression and subtropical storm status were first used beginning in 1968 at the advent of routine satellite imagery for the Atlantic basin. The low status – first used in 1987 - is for cyclones that are not tropical cyclone or subtropical cyclones, nor extratropical cyclones. These typically are assigned at the beginning of a system’s lifecycle and/or at the end of a system’s lifecycle. The tropical wave status – first used in 1981 - is almost exclusively for cyclones that degenerate into an open trough for a time, but then redevelop later in time into a tropical cyclone (for example, AL10-DENNIS in 1981 between 13 and 15 August). The disturbance status is similar to tropical wave and was first used in 1980. It should be noted that for tropical wave and disturbance status the location given is the approximate position of the lower tropospheric vorticity center, as the surface center no longer exists for these stages.\nMaximum sustained surface wind: This is defined as the maximum 1-min average wind associated with the tropical cyclone at an elevation of 10 m with an unobstructed exposure. Values are given to the nearest 10 kt for the years 1851 through 1885 and to the nearest 5 kt from 1886 onward. A value is assigned for every cyclone at every best track time. Note that the non-developing tropical depressions of 1967 did not have intensities assigned to them in the b-decks. These are indicated as “-99” currently, but will be revised and assigned an intensity when the Atlantic hurricane database reanalysis project (Hagen et al. 2012) reaches that hurricane season.\nCentral Pressure: These values are given to the nearest millibar. Originally, central pressure best track values were only included if there was a specific observation that could be used explicitly. Missing central pressure values are noted as “-999”. Beginning in 1979, central pressures have been analyzed and included for every best track entry, even if there was not a specific in-situ measurement available.\nWind Radii – These values have been best tracked since 2004 and are thus available here from that year forward with a resolution to the nearest 5 nm. Best tracks of the wind radii have not been done before 2004 and are listed as “-999” to denote missing data. Note that occasionally when there is a non-synoptic time best track entry included for either landfall or peak intensity, that the wind radii best tracks were not provided. These instances are also denoted with a “-999” in the database.\nRadius of Maximum Wind: These values have been best tracked only starting in 2021. Before 2021, the missing data are denoted as “-999”."

This data spans several decades, providing a comprehensive timeline for analysis.\nBy plotting time series graphs and conducting statistical trend analysis, we can identify patterns of change in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. For instance, an increase in the number of days exceeding a certain wind speed or precipitation threshold over time would indicate a trend toward more severe weather conditions.\nWe will cross-reference the dates and locations of high wind speed events with those of extreme precipitation events. The dataset’s temporal coverage allows for the examination of seasonal patterns."

By creating a varied range of plots, we will be able to study both the categorical and numerical variables present in our collection of data.\nThe first thing we were keen to observe was the trends in storm incidence over the years. These include hurricanes, tropical storms, as well as other type of climatological phenomena. The first plot shown below presents the upward incidence of storms.

Narrowing our spectrum of study will let us understand their behavioral patterns as well as their differences. Using box plots we can see how, while wind speed in Hurricanes is stronger than in Tropical Storms, the pressure in the former is lower than in the latter.\n\n\nCode\n# Boxplot to compare the windspeed and pressure of hurricanes vs tropical storms\n\n# 1 Boxplot of wind speed according to storm type\nggplot(hurricanes2, aes(x = hurricanes2$STATUS , y = hurricanes2$WINDSPEED_KT )) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  ggtitle(\"Boxplot of Wind Speed (KT) according to Storm Type\") +\n  labs(y = \"WindSpeed\", x = \"Storm Type\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# what if we look at the values of pressure that are not -999 (which I think it was not measured correctly)\nhurricanes2 &lt;- subset(hurricanes2, PRESURE_MB != -999)\n\nggplot(hurricanes2, aes(x = hurricanes2$STATUS , y = hurricanes2$PRESURE_MB )) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  ggtitle(\"Boxplot of Pressure according to Storm Type\") +\n  labs(y = \"Pressure\", x = \"Storm Type\")\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what has been the highest mean wind speed recorded in a Hurricane? and which Hurricane was this? Turns out Hurricane Hattie was the most notable in terms of wind speed. This Hurricane had a mean wind speed of 115 KT. It hit the coastal regions of Honduras and Guatemala in 1961 with an estimated monetary damage of around $60 million. Additionally, there were 319 fatalities.\n\n\nCode\n# what are the storms with the highest mean windspeed??\n# Group by HNAME and calculate mean windspeed\nmean_windspeed_by_hurricane &lt;- hurricanes2 %&gt;%\n  group_by(HNAME) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean_windspeed = mean(WINDSPEED_KT, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# Select the top 100 hurricanes based on mean windspeed\ntop_25_hurricanes &lt;- mean_windspeed_by_hurricane %&gt;%\n  top_n(25, mean_windspeed)\n\n# Create the plot for the top 100 hurricanes\nggplot(top_25_hurricanes, aes(x = mean_windspeed, y = fct_reorder(HNAME, mean_windspeed))) +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Top 25 Hurricanes by Mean Wind Speed\") +\n  ylab(\"\") +\n  theme_linedraw()\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Hattie has the top mean windspeed.

    "text": "This interactive map offers a dynamic and informative visualization of historical hurricane paths over the Atlantic Ocean.\nUsers can interactively select a specific hurricane from a dropdown menu, prompting the map to display the selected hurricane’s path. This path is plotted with precision, marking the hurricane’s progression over time based on its recorded geographical coordinates.\nNote: The map features circles drawn at each significant point along a hurricane’s path, where each circle’s size corresponds to the hurricane’s wind radii – a measure of the storm’s reach. Notably, these wind radii data points began to be systematically recorded after 2004.\n\nBlue circle represents the wind radius of at least 34kt\nYellow circle represents the wind radius of at least 50kt\nRed circle represents the wind radius of at least 64kt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect hurricane in the drop down menu below:\n\n\n\n\nThe map not only traces the hurricane’s route but also enriches the user experience with detailed information. As users hover over any point along the hurricane’s path, a tooltip appears, presenting key data such as the date, wind speed, and exact geographic coordinates. This feature allows for a detailed examination of the hurricane’s behavior and intensity at different stages of its journey.\nThe interactive map serves as a valuable tool for both educational and research purposes in the field of hurricane studies and meteorology. For educators and students, it provides a visual and engaging method to understand the patterns and impacts of hurricanes.\nBy visualizing historical data, researchers can identify common routes, observe changes in hurricane behaviors, and assess the frequency and intensity of these natural disasters in different regions. Such insights are crucial for improving predictive models and developing more effective strategies for disaster preparedness and response.\nThe visualization of long-term hurricane data can contribute to understanding how global warming and other environmental changes are influencing hurricane behavior. This knowledge is vital for policymakers and environmental planners to make informed decisions aimed at mitigating the impacts of climate change and protecting vulnerable coastal communities.\nOverall, this interactive hurricane tracking map stands as a testament to the power of data visualization in transforming raw data into meaningful insights, enhancing our understanding of natural phenomena and aiding in the development of solutions to some of the most pressing environmental challenges."
