# Introduction

It is no secret that due to climate change, we have seen an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events. These events range from devastating hurricanes and floods to severe droughts and heatwaves. This project aims to understand the patterns and trends of these events over time. 

Extreme weather events are natural occurrences, but their patterns can be significantly influenced by broader climatic changes. Studying these events helps us grasp the implications of a changing climate. It's not just about understanding the science; it's also about appreciating the real-world impacts - how these events affect ecosystems, human lives, and economies. With climate change being a pressing global issue, research in this area is not just academic but has profound real-world implications.

It is estimated that the cost generated by hurricanes in the United States since 1980 has surpassed 363 billion dollars. Highlighted Recurrently the states that see themselves impacted by these thermal
Florida
Louisiana
North Carolina
Texas
South Carolina

To narrow the scope of the project, we will focus on these locations, which according to NOAA is among the top states for hurricane frequency.

In this project, we are working with the data made publicly available by the Hurricane Research Division at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Points to highlight:
Problem:
Impact of hurricanes (economic, personal, healthcareâ€¦)
5 most damaged states ( louisiana, florida, nc, sc, texas)
Objective:
Study climate patterns and understand
