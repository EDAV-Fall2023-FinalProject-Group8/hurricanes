# Introduction

Over the last couple of decades, climate change has been cited as a major contributor to the increased frequency of extreme weather events such as hurricanes \[1\]. According to the Environmental Defense Fund, "stronger hurricanes are becoming more common in a warmer climate. Researchers suggest that the most damaging U.S. hurricanes are three times more frequent than 100 years ago and that the proportion of major hurricanes (Category 3 or above) in the Atlantic Ocean has doubled since 1980." This project aims to understand the patterns and trends of these events over time.

Extreme weather events are natural occurrences, but their patterns can be significantly influenced by broader climatic changes. Studying these events helps us grasp the implications of a changing climate. It's not just about understanding the science; it's also about appreciating the real-world impacts - how these events affect ecosystems, human lives, and economies. With climate change being a pressing global issue, research in this area is not just academic but has profound real-world implications.

It is estimated that the cost generated by hurricanes in the United States since 1980 has surpassed 363 billion dollars \[2\]. The figure below, provides an illustration of States that most at risk of hurricanes \[3\].

Recurrently, the states that see themselves most impacted by these tropical cyclones among other climate change phenomena are:

-   Florida

-   Louisiana

-   North Carolina

-   Texas

-   South Carolina

In this project we will analyze the data provided by the Hurricane Research Division at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in order to observe trends in storms and hurricanes over the past centuries.
