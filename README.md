### Analysis of Historical Hurricane Data.

In this project we provide an analysis of historical data on storms, cyclone, depressions, and hurricanes provided by the Hurricane Research Division at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In addition to the analysis and vizualiztions, the rendered book also includes an interactive map that allows the user to select a named hurricane and observe its path along with wind radii at certain thresholds.

Sections of the rendered book include:

-   Introduction: Motivating the research in question.

-   Data: Description of the data used in the project, initial processing and missing value analysis, in addition to outlining the research plan

-   Results: Analysis and Visualizations of the Data

-   Interactive Graph: An interactive map to observe certain named hurricanes.

-   Conclusion: Summarizing findings and future work.
